<ul>
<li> The Spring Framework provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications - on any kind of deployment platform. </li>
<li> A key element of Spring is infrastructural support at the application level </li>
<li>Spring focuses on the "plumbing" of enterprise applications so that teams can focus on application-level business logic, without unnecessary ties to specific deployment environments.
</li>
</ul>

<ol type="1">
<li>Dependency Injection</li>
<li>Aspect-Oriented Programming including Spring's declarative transaction management</li>
<li>Spring MVC web application and RESTful web service framework
</li>
<li>Foundational support for JDBC, JPA, JMS</li>

	<li>Spring Framework includes a number of different modules</li>
<li>Here we are showing spring-context which provides core functionality. </li>

<li>Java is a high-level programming language originally developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. </li>
<li>Java runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX.</li>
<li>Some features include Object Oriented, Platform Independent, Robust, Interpreted, Multi-threaded</li>
</ol >


<ol type="i">
	<li>Java uses Just-In-Time compiler to enable high performance.</li>
<li>Just-In-Time compiler is a program that turns Java bytecode, which is a program that contains instructions that must be interpreted into instructions that can be sent directly to the processor.</li>
<li>It’s compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format, which makes the compiled code to be executable on many processors, with the presence of Java runtime system.</li>
</ol>

<ol type="I">
<li>It is designed to adapt to an evolving environment. Java programs can carry extensive amount of run-time information that can be used to verify and resolve accesses to objects on run-time.</li>
<li>When Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run.</li>
<li>Object is a runtime entity and it’s state is stored in fields and behavior is shown via methods. Methods operate on an object's internal state and serve as the primary mechanism for object-to-object communication.</li>
<li>A class is a blue print from which individual objects are created. A class can contain fields and methods to describe the behavior of an object.
